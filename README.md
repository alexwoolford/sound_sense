# Sound Sense

A simple audio transcription tool that captures audio input, saves it into WAV format, and transcribes it using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

This is a personal project and runs on an [Orange Pi 5B](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5B.html), running [Armbian 23.08](https://docs.armbian.com/), that's attached to a [Focusrite Scarlett 6i6](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Scarlet6i6G2--focusrite-scarlett-6i6-usb-audio-interface). You might need to make configuration changes if you want to use it in a different environment.

Make sure to set up the appropriate path to the Whisper model:


```rust
let model_path = "/home/alexwoolford/whisper.cpp/models/ggml-small.en.bin";
```

The executable transcribes audio to timestamped JSON files:

    {
        "file_name": "audio_20230824011133.wav",
        "transcriptions": [
            {
                "start": "2023-08-24T01:11:33.900+00:00",
                "end": "2023-08-24T01:11:34+00:00",
                "text": "Blessed be the fruit."
            },
            {
                "start": "2023-08-24T01:11:34+00:00",
                "end": "2023-08-24T01:11:34.100+00:00",
                "text": "May the Lord open."
            },
            {
                ...
            {
        ]
    }
